                  The children of an element node are a sequence of nodes

                  are ignored and adjacent pieces of text are merged into
                  a single text node. In order to keep the representation
                  independent from validation, white space in element content
                  is represented by a text node.

             The document forest is a sequence of nodes. It consists of a
            single element node representing the document element, preceded
            or followed by a processing instruction node for each processing
            instruction which precedes or follows it in the XML document,
            including those processing instructions that occur within the
            DTD.

             For a node in the forest, the other children of its parent node
            are called its <EM>siblings</EM>; those which precede it are the
            left siblings and those that follow the right siblings. A <EM>descendant</EM>
            of a node is either a child of the node or a descendant of one
            of its children. Similarly, an <EM>ancestor</EM> of a node is
            either its parent or an ancestor of its parent. A node together
            with its descendants form the <EM>subtree rooted at</EM> that
            node. For brevity, when the context is clear, we sometimes identify
            a node with the element it represents or with the subtree rooted
            at that node.

    <P>
       Normally, <I>fxgrep</I> implements a query by consecutive runs of two
      forest automata, the first traversing from right to left and the second
      traversing from left to right. The second pass reports all matches of
      the query in document order. 
    </P>
    <P>
       If the query is simple enough, a single run of an automaton suffices.
      In this case <I>fxgrep</I> offers two processing modes: Either the automaton
      is run on the constructed document forest (default), or it is run during
      parsing, without explicitly constructing the forest. The second method
      might be slower because it requires demand-driven construction of only those
      parts of the document forest that might match the query, but it has
      the advantage of avoiding in-memory construction of the possibly huge
      document forest. This behavior is controlled by command-line options.
